# Pandemic

# Summary
The overall idea behind this project is to simulate an epidemic. We will be showing how rapid a virus can spread in a given population. As well as showing number of cured people and time it takes for them to get better. 

# Motivation
Since we came out of a gloabl pandemic not too long ago, it will be benificial to be able to predict how long another one will last, how many people will get infected, die and get better. We need to be prepared for another one and be able to know how bad it can get.

# Math

$$
N_d = E * p * N_d
$$

$$
N_{d+1} = N_d + E * p * N_{d}
$$

$$
N_(d+1) = (1 + E * p)N_d
$$

# Objective 
In this simulation we are going to show the infection rate, death rate, and cure rate of the population. Then graph it in a little animation. As well as show a dot graph displaying an example of the infection spreading. This will be helpful because it show how long a virus can spread for and try to figure out the amount of people that will die. This can be important because if too many people die, then obviousl that is a bad thing. We will have to stop it somehow before it gets to that point. We would also be able to play with the infection rate and what if a virus is very deadly, we can pinpoint when we will hit a critical point in the pouplation. Similar to the movies when a zombie virus spreads and kills many people.
